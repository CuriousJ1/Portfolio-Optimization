# Portfolio-Optimization

## Introduction

“Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), a hypothesis put forth by Harry Markowitz in his paper “Portfolio Selection,” (published in 1952 by the Journal of Finance) is an investment theory based on the idea that risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to optimize or maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk, emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher reward. It is one of the most important and influential economic theories dealing with finance and investment.

Therefore, In this project, we focus on 2 ways to create the most effecient portfolios using Monte Carlo simulations and SciPy to create an efficient frontier, being the set of optimal portfolios that offers the highest expected return using the for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.

The stocks we use are:

* Apple
* Cisco
* Google
* IBM

The code is based on my own exploration of Python's functionalities and libraries.
